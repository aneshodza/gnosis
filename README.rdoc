Welcome to gnosis!
This is a Redmine Plugin with the goal of making your development process easier to keep an overview of.

== What does this plugin do?
Gnosis is able to show you GitHub Pull Requests and Deployments that belong to a Redmine issue, all in its "details" page.  
To make this magic work there are only a few steps you have to follow and certain conventions to keep in mind. For additional 
info, refer to the official README.md.
